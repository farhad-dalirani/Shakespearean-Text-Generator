# Shakespearean Text Generator

This repository contains a very simple transformer neural network trained on the works of Shakespeare. The code is based on `Vaswani, Ashish, et al. "Attention is all you need." Advances in neural information processing systems 30 (2017)` and `Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out` Youtube video by Andrej Karpathy.

The network generates text that resembles Shakespearean language, allowing users to experience the charm and style of the renowned playwright. Although the output may not always make sense, it showcases the capabilities of the transformer architecture and serves as an educational tool for understanding natural language processing and language generation algorithms.

The code for the Shakespearean Text Generator can be found in the file `Shakespearean-Text-Generator.ipynb`, while the data used by the generator is stored in the file `input.txt`. Training the model on Google Colab T4 GPU takes around 45 minutes.

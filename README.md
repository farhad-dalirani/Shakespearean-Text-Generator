# Shakespearean Text Generator

This repository contains a very simple transformer neural network trained on the works of Shakespeare. The code is based on `Vaswani, Ashish, et al. "Attention is all you need." Advances in neural information processing systems 30 (2017)` and `Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out` Youtube video by Andrej Karpathy.

The network generates text that resembles Shakespearean language, allowing users to experience the charm and style of the renowned playwright. Although the output may not always make sense, it showcases the capabilities of the transformer architecture and serves as an educational tool for understanding natural language processing and language generation algorithms.

The code for the Shakespearean Text Generator can be found in the file `Shakespearean-Text-Generator.ipynb`, while the data used by the generator is stored in the file `input.txt`. Training the model on Google Colab T4 GPU takes around 45 minutes.


Here is an example output generated by the model:
```
ABHORSON:
What should the Capulet's daughter? Dost thou?

SOMERSET:
Marry, sir, no man stop to her.

HORTENSIO:
One poor Romeo more son, and be a
balefant words in the things. O, sir, I am respected
more with him and friendship of a tyrant!

TYRREL:
O, think you shall not dream,
Whose treason seven sons should be so in man's
Shall dispose the seas, and like even false with me
I betray my adversed pluck my foot: then yet I
In sister what I plainly was while as smuch as
You shall.

GLOUCESTER:
I would it go against your cousin; and I was
Against your body or in the leisure of youth:
Is it thou remembran not to begetter thy flight?
I will but a scolding friend
Thee, uncle you and forswear to beging this Katham,
Why stoling you look'd by him met a command.
O many is her protectors?
'Tis subound to save: we cannot know her, my lord,
I shall be certain'd to my hope.
How now! What, yea present your honour
